## 🎯 Introduction

SurakshaVault introduces a **Trust-as-a-Service** model for responsible data sharing across fintech ecosystems. In an era where data is vulnerable the moment it leaves your platform, our system ensures control, compliance, and clarity travel *with* the data—wherever it goes.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Fintechs face a growing challenge:

- **Data Vulnerability**: Sensitive data is frequently shared (banking, PII, income, behavioral data)
- **Limited Control**: APIs provide little post-sharing control or visibility
- **User Concerns**: Users fear data misuse, fraud, and unauthorized access
- **Regulatory Pressure**: GDPR, India's DPDP demands privacy-by-design, consent enforcement, and auditability
- **Expanded Attack Surface**: Integrations with third parties (Open Banking) increase security risks

---

## 💡 Solution

SurakshaVault offers a comprehensive data governance solution:

- 🔒 **Granular, pseudonymized data sharing** via encrypted tokens
- 🤖 **AI-driven fraud detection** and behavior validation
- ⛓️ **Immutable blockchain audit trails**
- 📊 **User dashboards** for complete visibility and consent management
- 📋 **Regulation-ready compliance engine** for GDPR and DPDP Act

Our mission is to make data "smart"—self-governing, purpose-bound, and auditable beyond platform boundaries.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔐 Post-Sharing Data Control
- Data is tokenized and decrypted only on verified clients

### ⚖️ Built-In Compliance
- Lifecycle-based consent management (grant, revoke, auto-expiry)
- Full support for "Right to be Forgotten"
- Least privilege sharing by default

### 🧠 Proactive AI Security
- Local fraud detection using IP, geo, and behavior patterns
- Smart access validation using AI before data is delivered

### 📊 Radical Transparency
- Blockchain-powered audit logs
- Real-time user access logs & consent history
- Admin command center for full visibility

### 🔗 One Platform, Many Defenses
- 3-tier access model: Admin, Partner, User
- Verified onboarding (CIN/DIN based)
- Frontend-only decryption in zero-trust architecture
